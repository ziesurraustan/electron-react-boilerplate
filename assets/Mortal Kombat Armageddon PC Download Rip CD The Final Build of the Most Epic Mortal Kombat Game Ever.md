You can choose from classic characters like Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, Raiden, and Sonya Blade, as well as newer ones like Kenshi, Frost, Bo' Rai Cho, and Ashrah.
- It has a new create-a-fighter mode, where you can customize your own character's appearance, fighting style, special moves, weapons, and costumes. You can also unlock new items and abilities by playing the game's modes and completing challenges.
- It has a new create-a-fatality system, where you can perform brutal finishing moves on your opponents by pressing a sequence of buttons. The longer the sequence, the more gruesome the fatality. You can also use environmental objects and weapons to enhance your fatalities.
- It has a new Konquest mode, where you play as Taven, a warrior who must stop his brother Daegon from unleashing Armageddon on the realms. You will explore various locations, fight enemies, solve puzzles, and interact with other characters. You will also unlock secrets and rewards along the way.
- It has a bonus arcade port of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, which is considered one of the best Mortal Kombat games ever made. It has 22 playable characters, 8 stages, and classic gameplay mechanics. You can access this port by selecting it from the main menu.
- It has a Wii version that has a new motion-based control system, along with compatibility with the classic and GameCube controllers. It has a new Endurance Mode, a Wii Remote Training Mode, new menu screens, and Khameleon as a playable character[^1^]. However, this version does not have online features.

Mortal Kombat: Armageddon is a game that offers a lot of content and variety for fans of the series. It is a fitting conclusion to the original Mortal Kombat saga.
