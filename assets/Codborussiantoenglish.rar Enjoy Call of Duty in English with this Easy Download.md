2. Unrar the file and follow the instructions inside the pack. You will need to copy some files to your game folder and edit some registry entries.

4. Run the VPN software and select a Russian server. Enter the username and password if required.
5. Launch Steam and log into your account. Enter your CD key for Call of Duty Black Ops and activate it.
6. Close Steam and disconnect the VPN software.
7. Launch Steam again and enjoy playing Call of Duty Black Ops in English.

Note: You only need to use the VPN once for activation. You can play the game without VPN afterwards.
